## Introduction

This is HealthHub, a web application designed for medical professionals and students, providing a comprehensive set of tools and features for learning and practicing various aspects of medical imaging and diagnostics. Built with Flask, it offers the following key features:

1. **Brain MRI Image Generation**:
   - Generates brain MRI images with tumors using a stable diffusion model and Dream Booth technology.
   - Generates brain MRI images of healthy brains with GAN for comparative analysis.

2. **Quiz Generator**:
   - Allows users to enter text or medical case descriptions.
   - Utilizes AI to automatically generate quizzes based on the input.
   - Calculates and displays quiz scores to assess the user's understanding.

3. **3D Brain Visualization**:
   - Provides an interactive 3D visualization of the brain for a more in-depth understanding of its anatomy and structures.

4. **Brain Tumor Detection**:
   - Performs brain tumor detection with classification into different types.
   - Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms for accurate diagnosis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask (install via `pip install Flask`)
- Additional Python libraries and dependencies required for image generation, AI, and visualization (please provide installation instructions if needed).

## âœ¨ How to use it

> Download the code 

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yahyasamet/HealthHubv2.git
$ cd HealthHubv2
```

<br />

### ðŸ‘‰ Set Up for `Windows` 

> Install modules via `VENV` (windows) 

```
$ python venv venv
$ .\venv\Scripts\activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

and you should install the Gan model from here https://huggingface.co/spaces/yahyasmt/Brain-MR-Image-Generation-with-StyleGAN/tree/main
you copy the file brainmrigan.pkl and make it in to HealthHubv2 folder
```

<br />

> Set Up Flask Environment

```bash
$ # CMD 
$ set FLASK_APP=run.py
$ set FLASK_ENV=development
$
$ # Powershell
$ $env:FLASK_APP = ".\run.py"
$ $env:FLASK_ENV = "development"
```

<br />

> Start the app

```bash
$ flask run
```

At this point, the app runs at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
